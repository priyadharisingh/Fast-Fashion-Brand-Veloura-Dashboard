# Fast-Fashion-Brand-Veloura-Dashboard
The dashboard provides a deep insight of the business metrics for the fast fashion brand named Veloura.

# Background:
Veloura is a fast-fashion brand selling products ranging from swim-wear and inner-wear to dresses, accessories and many more. New York, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Savannah are a few among the many stores they own. They have been a part of this business for nearly 6 years now and  the graphs shows a continuous YOY increase in the sales. 
The company wanted to have an idea about the business metrics and also wanted visually appealing charts to showcase in front of the stakeholders.

# Business Problem:
The fashion industry moves quickly, and decisions need to be made in real time. The dashboard was built to give your team a single source of truth about sales, inventory, customer preferences, and returns. It helps identify what’s selling, what’s not, and where opportunities exist.

# Limitations & Assumptions:
•	The dashboard reflects data as per current systems — any manual errors in entry will flow into visuals.<br>
•	Return reasons are only as detailed as captured in the system (e.g., size, quality).<br>
•	Live updates depend on syncing frequency (daily/hourly).<br>

# Data Used
•	Sources: Point-of-sale systems, e-commerce platform, inventory management, marketing campaigns.<br>
•	Coverage: Daily/weekly/monthly sales, product categories (tops, dresses, jeans, etc.), customer demographics, regional performance.<br>
•	Key Metrics Captured:<br>
o	Sales by product, region<br>, store, channel (online/offline)<br>
o	Return & cancellation rates<br>

# Dashboard Design
1.	Sales Overview – total revenue, sales trend, top categories.<br>
2.	Customer Insights – demographics, repeat vs new buyers.<br>
3.	Inventory & Stock – sell-through rate, aging stock, out-of-stock alerts.<br>
4.	Returns & Cancellations – items with high return rates (e.g., sizing issues).<br>
5.	Marketing Performance – campaign ROI, seasonal sales spikes.<br>

# Analysis:
•	The company has performed incredibly well in the year 2023 with the YOY % increase in revenue equaling 104.14%. The overall revenue each customer generated is $257.11. Key metrics that has helped in generating this huge amount of sales should be noted and measures should be taken to use them in the subsequent years.<br>
•	Search engines drive most amount of Sales. Investment should be made to ensure high ranking on these platforms.<br>
•	Products returning back to the inventory after being sold is one of the biggest problem in the ecommerce industry. The products have a return rate of 9.94%. This needs to tackled as soon as possible.<br>

# Conclusion:
The dashboard is of utmost importance and can provide real time access to stakeholders about the operations of the company. It helps get a detailed insight about every aspect of the business, thus helping them make informed decision.
